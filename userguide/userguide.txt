Upload a data file
The DDI-CDI Converter tool allows you to easily convert your STATA or SPSS data files into DDI-CDI format. Here's how to get started by uploading your data file:
Supported file formats: The tool accepts two common statistical data formats:
STATA data files (.dta)
SPSS data files (.sav)
Upload your file: In the main interface, you'll see a dashed box with the text "Drag and Drop or Select a File". You have two options for uploading:
Drag and drop method: Simply drag your .dta or .sav file from your file explorer and drop it into the dashed box.
File selection method: Click on the "Select a File" link, which will open your computer's file browser. Navigate to your data file, select it, and click "Open".
Processing: After uploading, the tool will automatically:
Read and process your file
Display a preview of your data in a table format
Prepare the interface for further data exploration and conversion tasks
Important notes:
Only one file can be uploaded at a time
For optimal performance, the tool is configured to process a limited number of rows by default (5 rows)
Large files may take a moment to process
After successful upload, you'll see your data displayed and can proceed with the conversion tasks
Once your file is uploaded, you'll be ready to proceed with the next steps of the DDI-CDI conversion process.

Explore the data file

After uploading your data file, the DDI-CDI Converter tool provides comprehensive ways to explore and understand your data. The tool offers two complementary views to help you examine your dataset:

Data View

The Data View presents your actual data in a tabular format, similar to what you would see in statistical software like STATA or SPSS:

1. Data Preview: The tool displays a preview of your dataset, showing the actual data values in a structured table.
   
2. Data Exploration: You can scroll through the data to get a feel for the content and structure of your dataset.
   
3. Column Headers: Each column represents a variable from your dataset, with the variable name displayed as the header.

4. Row Preview: By default, the tool shows a limited number of rows for performance reasons, but this gives you a good representation of your data.

Variable View

The Variable View provides detailed metadata about each variable in your dataset:

1. Switch to Variable View: Click the "Switch View" button to toggle between the Data View and Variable View.

2. Variable Metadata: The Variable View displays comprehensive information about each variable, including:
   - Name: The variable name as defined in your dataset
   - Format: The data type (e.g., F4.0, F1.0, F2.0) indicating numeric precision and display format
   - Label: The descriptive label that provides context about what the variable represents
   - Values: The coded values and their corresponding labels (e.g., for categorical variables)
   - Missing: Information about defined missing values
   - Measure: The measurement type (scale, nominal, ordinal)

3. Variable Role Selection: In the Variable View, you can classify each variable according to its role in your data:
   - Measure: Variables containing the actual measurements or observations
   - Identifier: Variables that uniquely identify records (used as the primary key)
   - Attribute: Variables that provide additional information about the measures

4. Role Selection Process:
   - Click on the dropdown in the "role" column for each variable
   - Select the appropriate role (Measure, Attribute, or Identifier)
   - Variables classified as Identifiers will be used to uniquely identify records in the converted output

5. Guidance Text: The interface provides helpful instructions: "Please select variable role. Identifiers are used for the PrimaryKey to uniquely identify the records."

Best Practices for Data Exploration

1. Review Both Views: Switch between both views to gain a complete understanding of your data before proceeding with conversion.

2. Identify Key Variables: Pay special attention to identifying which variables should serve as identifiers (primary keys).

3. Check Value Labels: Review the value labels in the Variable View to ensure categorical variables are properly understood.

4. Examine Missing Values: Take note of how missing values are coded in your dataset, as this will affect the conversion.

5. Understand Variable Types: The measurement types (scale, nominal, ordinal) will influence how the data is represented in DDI-CDI format.

Once you've explored your data and assigned appropriate roles to variables, you'll be ready to proceed with generating the DDI-CDI output.

Select granularity of output and download results

After exploring your data and assigning variable roles, you can generate and download the DDI-CDI representation of your dataset. The tool provides several options to customize the output according to your needs:

Configure output granularity

The DDI-CDI Converter allows you to control how much of your data is included in the output:

1. Include data rows option:
   - Toggle the switch labeled "Include data rows (limited to 5 rows for large datasets)" to determine whether actual data values should be included in the output.
   - When turned OFF: Only the metadata (variable definitions, labels, etc.) will be included in the output.
   - When turned ON: Both metadata and actual data values will be included in the output.

2. Process ALL rows option (appears when "Include data rows" is enabled):
   - Toggle the switch labeled "Process ALL rows (may be slow for large datasets)" to control how many data rows are included.
   - When turned OFF: Only the first 5 rows of data will be included in the output (recommended for large datasets).
   - When turned ON: All rows from your dataset will be included in the output (may impact performance for large datasets).

3. Performance warnings:
   - The tool will display contextual warnings based on your dataset size and selected options.
   - Example: "Warning: Your dataset has 2,582 rows. For performance reasons, only the first 5 rows will be included in the XML/JSON-LD output."
   - These warnings help you make informed decisions about output granularity, especially for large datasets.

Select output format and download

The DDI-CDI Converter supports two standard output formats:

1. Choose output format:
   - XML: Click the "XML" button to generate DDI-CDI in XML format. This follows the DDI-CDI XML Schema specification.
   - JSON-LD: Click the "JSON-LD" button to generate DDI-CDI in JSON-LD format. This follows the DDI-CDI JSON-LD context specification.

2. Preview the output:
   - After selecting a format, the tool will display a preview of the generated DDI-CDI representation.
   - The preview shows the structured output with proper formatting, allowing you to verify the content before downloading.

3. Download the output:
   - Click the "Download" button to save the currently displayed output to your computer.
   - The file will be automatically named based on your original data file, with the appropriate extension:
     - .xml for XML format
     - .jsonld for JSON-LD format

4. Output content:
   - The generated output includes:
     - DDI-CDI structural metadata (dataset information, variable definitions)
     - Value labels and coding information
     - Missing value specifications
     - Actual data values (if "Include data rows" is enabled)
     - Proper namespaces and context references

Best practices for output generation

1. Start with metadata only: For initial testing, keep "Include data rows" turned off to quickly generate and validate the structural metadata.

2. Test with limited rows: When including data, start with the default 5-row limit to ensure the output structure meets your expectations.

3. Consider file size: For large datasets, be cautious about enabling "Process ALL rows" as it may generate very large output files that are difficult to work with.

4. Validate your output: Consider using the validation tools mentioned in the validation notes to verify that your generated DDI-CDI conforms to the specification.

5. Compare formats: Generate both XML and JSON-LD versions to determine which format best suits your downstream applications.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively generate DDI-CDI representations of your data that balance completeness with practical usability.
